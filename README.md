# Wine quality testing machine learning code

This code was used as part of a final project for a data analysis bootcamp in which the goal was to train a machine language model to predict quality scores for wine based on specific factors.  A direct breakdown of the code is included in the ipynb files themselves.  An additional "wine creator file" was created in order to generate a completely fresh data file for the trained model to generate scores for.

The data for this project has been split into two separate directories:  a dataset directory and a code directory.

## Data Sets
Two separate CSV files were used for this project.  The wine_training_data.csv file includes the initial dataset downloaded from Kaggle.  The winequality-sample-set.csv file is the sample wine file created using random number generator code to simulate a batch of wine created by the fictional winery.
