# Wine quality testing machine learning code

This code was used as part of a final project for a data analysis bootcamp in which the goal was to train a machine language model to predict quality scores for wine based on specific factors.  A direct breakdown of the code is included in the ipynb files themselves.  An additional "wine creator file" was created in order to generate a completely fresh data file for the trained model to generate scores for.
